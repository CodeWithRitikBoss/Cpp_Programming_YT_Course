File handling in C++ allows developers to create, read, write, and manipulate files efficiently.  
The fstream library provides classes like ifstream, ofstream, and fstream for file operations.  
Using file handling, data can be stored persistently beyond the program's execution.  
Proper error handling is crucial to ensure files are opened and closed correctly.  
Mastering file handling is essential for building robust and data-driven C++ applications.
